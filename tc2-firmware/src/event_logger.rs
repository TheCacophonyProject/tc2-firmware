// TODO: Essentially we want to log an error code and a timestamp for each error/event to flash storage.
//  There would be a maximum number of errors we can store before we run out of memory.  Timestamp can
//  be in 32bit seconds past a given epoch (let's say Jan 1 2023).  Is a 1 second granularity enough?
